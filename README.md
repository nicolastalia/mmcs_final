This project was done by Daniel Kopisitskiy, Nicolas Talia, Teng Wei Yeo, and Sara Brdnik.


To study the output from the csv files generated from our model and used from our report, run 'output_analyser.ipynb' 

To study our code which produces the csv files, see the following:
1) For the final version of Model 1, run 'final_model1.ipynb', which uses code in 'final_model1.py'.
2) For the final version of Model 2, run 'model vv5 (with loop, 2nd stage model).py'.
3) For the final version of Model 2 trained over the whole dataset and run retrospectively on the whole data, run 'model vv6 (fully trained model on whole dataset).py'
4) For the final version of Model 2 without seeing false negatives, run 'bayes.py'.

Thank you for reading!

Copies of all our produced outputs are also in the main folder of the repository. 
The folder "backup outputs" contains backup outputs.
